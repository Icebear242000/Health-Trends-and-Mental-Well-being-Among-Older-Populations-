# Health Trends and Mental Well-being Among Older Populations  

## 📌 Introduction  
This project explores health trends and mental well-being among older populations using data analysis and machine learning. We use visualization techniques and predictive models to analyze health factors across different demographic groups.  

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Identify trends in health outcomes over time.  
- Analyze geographic variations in health indicators.  
- Examine stratifications by age, gender, and race.  
- Predict key health outcomes using machine learning models.  

## 🗂 Dataset  
- **Source:** Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) & Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)  
- **Period:** 2015 – 2021  
- **Size:** 250,938 records, 31 features  

## 🔧 Technologies Used  
- **Data Analysis:** PySpark, SQL, MongoDB  
- **Machine Learning:** Spark MLlib (Linear Regression, Gradient Boosted Trees)  
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis  
- Distribution of health conditions across demographic groups  
- Trends in arthritis, mental health, and obesity  
- Variations in health topics over the years
